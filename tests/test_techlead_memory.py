"""The tech-lead's memory (the gap the product owner flagged: "having no memory is very worrying").

Before this, its whole memory was one number — how many distinct tickets had failed each way. It
could count, but it could not recognise; it could not say what it tried, because `_remedied` died
with the workflow; and nothing anywhere recorded whether anything worked.

The third gap is the expensive one: a remedy that has never worked looked exactly like one that
always works, so the factory could retry the same useless thing on every ticket at a full agent pass
each time, and every retry looked like diligence.
