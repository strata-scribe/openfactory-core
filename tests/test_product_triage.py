"""Reading the board — and the mistake this module exists to prevent.

On 2026-07-26 two tickets sat in "In progress" with no job running, which looks exactly like a board
lying about its own state. They were a human-owned spike whose body says "NOT for the automated
coding pipeline", and an epic whose children were being executed. Both were correct; the reading was
wrong, because it judged a column without opening the ticket.

So the tests below spend more effort on what triage must NOT flag than on what it must.
