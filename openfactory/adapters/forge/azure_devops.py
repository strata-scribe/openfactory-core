"""AzureReposForge — branches, pull requests, merges and tags in Azure Repos.

The second vendor on the forge axis, written against the live API of a client Azure DevOps project
rather than against the reference docs. Four things it observed there are load-bearing, and each
one is a place where the GitHub shape would have produced a wrong adapter:

    A PR ID IS PROJECT-WIDE, NOT PER-REPOSITORY.  Proven: PR 2 was opened in one repository of
        the project and the next PR opened in `fx-ado` came back as 3 — one counter for the whole
        project. So a bare number is an unambiguous ref, and `git/pullrequests/{id}` (no repository
        segment) resolves it. But every WRITE route is repository-scoped, and asking the wrong
        repository for a valid id gives `404 TF401180`, not another PR. Hence `_pr`: resolve once
        through the project-scoped route, then address every write at the repository the PR itself
        names — never at `self.repo`. This is github.py's C-18 lesson (`update_branch` silently
        updating a same-numbered PR in the default repo) arriving before it could cost anything.

    COMPLETION IS ASYNCHRONOUS.  Proven: the PATCH that sets `status: completed` came back with
        `status: "active"` and `closedDate: null`; six seconds later the PR read `completed`. So
        `merge_pr` must not verify its own result, and a `pr_merged` immediately after a merge is
        legitimately False. The durable merge-watch already expects exactly that.

    `lastMergeCommit` IS NOT A MERGE.  Proven: PR 4 was abandoned without ever merging and still
        carried `lastMergeCommit.commitId: 15d18232…`; on PR 3 the value CHANGED at completion
        (807defdb… → 73531f4f…). Azure Repos publishes a speculative preview merge there to tell
        you whether the PR *would* merge. Reading it unconditionally would hand the post-merge
        deploy (ADR-0005) a commit that exists on no branch. `merge_commit_sha` therefore returns
        None unless the PR is `completed`.

    "CI EXISTS BUT NOTHING GATES THE MERGE" IS AZURE DEVOPS'S DEFAULT, NOT ITS EDGE CASE.  Proven:
        `fx-ado` has a real pipeline (`fx-ado-ci`) that builds `main`, and `policy/configurations`
        for the project is `[]`, so `policy/evaluations` for a live PR is `[]` too. Unlike GitHub
        Actions, a YAML `pr:` trigger does nothing for an Azure Repos repository — PR validation
        IS a branch policy. That makes the live defect github.py's `pr_ci_status` records ("a repo
        with CI but no branch protection must read `none`, not hang the merge watch") the NORMAL
        state here rather than a misconfiguration, so `none` is the answer this adapter gives most
        often and the merge watch must never wait on it.

Everything else follows the sibling. Where a decision was ours to make — merge strategy, what
happens to the source branch, who owns the work item's state — the reason is on the line.

        `AzureDevOpsClient.values()` ends `return out if isinstance(out, list) else []` — so an
        answer whose `value` is missing or is not a list arrives as an EMPTY COLLECTION, which is
        this port's word for "I read the repository and there is nothing in it". `call()` already
        raises on a non-JSON body and on every HTTP error, but a 200 or 204 carrying no body at all
        comes back as `{}` and lands squarely in that hole. The GitHub sibling answers None for
        exactly these shapes and has a named test for it; a port whose two providers disagree about
        which answer means "unreadable" is not a port, and the caller that believes the empty one
        mints a requirement number a live `req/*` branch already claims.

        A DELETE IS A REF UPDATE TO FORTY ZEROES, and the live API answers three different words
        for what looks like one outcome. All three were produced against `fx-ado` on 2026-08-06,
        by creating a scratch ref and taking it apart again:

            succeeded               the ref was there at the object id we named, and is gone
            succeededCorruptRef     the ref was there at a DIFFERENT id, and is gone anyway
            succeededNonExistentRef there was no such ref; nothing was deleted

        `oldObjectId` IS SENT AS ZEROES ON PURPOSE, and the middle line above is why that is a
        decision rather than laziness. Azure Repos would happily do a compare-and-swap if we read
        the branch's head first and named it — it answers `succeededCorruptRef` precisely because
        we did not. But GitHub's `DELETE git/refs/heads/<b>` has no conditional form at all, so
        making this one conditional would give the SAME port call two different meanings on two
        vendors: on Azure a branch that moved since we read it survives, on GitHub it does not.
        A provider is configuration; a provider that quietly changes whether work can be lost is
        not. One unconditional delete, both vendors, and the difference stays in this comment
        instead of in a client's repository.

        THE HTTP STATUS IS NOT THE VERDICT. All of the above come back as `200 OK` with the real
        answer in `value[0].success` — a provider that trusted the status code would report a
        `permissionDenied` as a successful cleanup. Anything that is not an explicit success is
        False, with the server's own word in the log so the refusal is findable.

        `repo` IS LOAD-BEARING HERE IN A WAY IT IS NOT ON `pr_status`, and the difference is that
        this is a CREATE: there is no id yet to resolve the repository from, so the route has to be

        would file a second one every time.

        THE BODY IS STORED VERBATIM, AND THAT WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. Azure Boards
        HTML-sanitises every long-text write, so `System.Description` silently truncates at the

        API is a different resource and the question was open, which mattered: a code-review
        comment saying `if (a<b) { x }` losing everything after the `<` is the shape a reviewer
        would never think to check, because the ticket path had already taught them the opposite.

        Probed live on fx-ado PR #8 (2026-08-06): a description and a thread comment each carrying
        a fenced java block, a bare `<placeholder>` and `List<String>` both round-tripped

        opposite actions here.

        RENAMED AWAY FROM `_pr_for_head` when the public `pr_for_head` arrived. The two differ by
        one underscore and disagree on both axes: this one asks only about ACTIVE pull requests
        (an abandoned PR must not stop a fresh one being opened) and raises when it cannot read;
        the public one asks about every state and returns None when it cannot read. Neighbouring
        methods with inverted sentinels get told apart by a duplicate PR in production, so they
        are told apart by their names instead.

        THE SHAPE IS CHECKED HERE RATHER THAN LEFT TO `values()`, and this is the method where
        getting it wrong actually costs something. `list_branches` and `pr_for_head` each argue
        the point at length two screens up and both hand-roll the check; THIS one — the gate that
        decides whether `open_pr` CREATES a pull request — went through the helper, and the helper
        ends `return out if isinstance(out, list) else []`. `call()` raises on every HTTP error and
        on a non-JSON body, but a 200 or 204 carrying no body at all comes back as `{}`, so an
        answer this adapter could not read arrived as an empty COLLECTION and this returned None:
        "no pull request is open from that branch". That is the single answer that makes `open_pr`
        POST a second one. Driven against the real adapter with a client returning `{}`, `open_pr`
        created a pull request off an idempotency lookup that had read nothing.

        SO IT RAISES, which is this method's stated contract and also what the sibling provider
        already does — `gh pr list --jq '.[0].url'` exits 1 with "expected an array but got:
        object" (measured), and GitHub's `_open_pr_for_head` turns that into a RuntimeError. The
        port's own `_gh_read` docstring says two providers behind one port must fail in the same
        vocabulary; here they did not, and only the vendor that hosts the client's documentation
        repository was the lenient one."""

                          description: str = "") -> tuple[str, bool]:
        """See `RepositoryCreatingForge`. `(project/name, created)`.

        WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL: without it a deployment with no GitHub anywhere could onboard a
        client who ALREADY had a context repository and not one who did not — which is most of
        them, and it is the first hour of the engagement. The pilot operator set the bar the day
        the mixed-vendor half was fixed: this platform may not be GitHub-only, because the
        deployment after the pilot is a 100% Azure DevOps enterprise (2026-08-12).

        THE COORDINATES COME FROM THIS ADAPTER, never from a parameter — the same rule the GitHub
        implementation states, and it matters more here: an Azure DevOps PAT is scoped to an
        ORGANISATION, so a caller able to name the project could create a repository anywhere in
        it. The new repository is created in the project this adapter already drives, and its
        identity is returned as `project/name` because that is what every other route here reads
        back (`coordinates` resolves the ADO project; the git repository is the leaf).

        `private` IS ACCEPTED AND CANNOT BE HONOURED, and saying so is better than pretending:
        Azure Repos has no per-repository visibility — a repository is as visible as the PROJECT
        that contains it. A deployment that needs a private context repository puts it in a
        private project, which is a decision taken before this call. Ignoring the flag silently
        would let a caller believe it had asked for something.

        IDEMPOTENT, like its GitHub sibling: an existing repository of that name returns
        `(…, False)` rather than raising, because a retry of a durable activity, a client who made
        it themselves and an earlier onboarding are all the expected case. And the creation is
        RE-READ before it is believed — a repository reported created that cannot be listed would
        surface an hour later as the product role failing to write a requirement, in a message
        about something else entirely.
