# OPENFACTORY_TRACKER_TOKEN then the same OPENFACTORY_BOT_TOKEN. This list carried two of the

# the one name no scrub removed — and on a personal GitHub account that override is the classic
# PAT `docs/setup/github.md` scopes `repo` + `project`, which pushes (measured 2026-08-26).
# The rule is the FALLBACK CHAIN, not the prefix: a name any reader serves for a listed secret is

    from our INFRASTRUCTURE. The container box already solved this: `box.env` names what passes
    through. The worktree had no such seam, and every judging role runs in a worktree — the sizer,
    the tech-lead's chat and diagnosis, the whole product module. So on a Bedrock deployment the
    executor and reviewer would work (they run in the box) while the tech-lead answered "could not
    answer" to every question and the size gate silently degraded. Nothing would have said why.

    The security property is UNCHANGED for anyone who declares nothing, and it is narrower than it
    looks even for those who do: what the operator names should be a credential scoped to invoking
    a model and nothing else, never the deployment's own task role. Naming it is an explicit,
    per-project decision made by whoever runs the factory — the same contract `box.env` already
    documents — rather than the blanket ambient identity this function exists to remove.
