"""ContainerSandbox — the real ephemeral environment (Docker).

Production path (ADR-0001 D-4): the container is where isolation is actually kept.

Design (clone-based, self-contained):
- On the host, make an ephemeral local clone of the repo (fast, self-contained
  `.git` — avoids the git-worktree-in-container path problem) on a fresh branch.
- Bind-mount that clone into a container built from a per-stack base image that
  already has the toolchain + git + the `claude` CLI. The container sees only
  `/workspace`, nothing else of the host.
- A dep-cache volume can be mounted so we don't pay a full install per job
  (`cache_volume`; unset by default, because sharing a cache across projects is a
  deployment's decision, not this class's).
- Auth is injected as env at run time (subscription token or API key), never baked.
- CPU and memory limits bound the blast radius: `--cpus` and `--memory`, applied on
  every run.

WHAT THIS BOX DOES **NOT** DO, stated because it used to claim the opposite. These
lines, and the matching ones in `base.py` and `registry.py`, said the box denied
egress unless allowed. It does not, and it cannot: `network` defaults to `bridge`,
which is **full outbound internet**, and it has to be — the harness dials its API and
the manifest's `setup:` runs `pip install` / `dotnet restore` / `npm ci`. Cutting the
box off from the internet would break every job.

A false security claim is worse than no claim, because it is consumed as a control:
somebody deciding what a client's box may touch reads a promise of egress control and
stops thinking. The true statement is the useful one — **anything the box's network can
reach is reachable by code the agent wrote** — and a deployment that needs that
bounded sets `network` to its own egress-restricted network or proxy, which is now a
knob the registry can actually pass (it constructed this class with `image=` alone,
so all four of the others were unreachable).

ADR-0037 makes the image the CLIENT's, which turns "what can this box reach?" from a
theoretical question into one somebody will genuinely ask.

        This used to end `except subprocess.TimeoutExpired: return timeout_result(command,
        timeout)` — two arguments where the function has always taken three. The worktree passed
        its partial output; the container passed none. So the four-hour wall arrived on the box
        that matters most with the whole stream already discarded, and every reader downstream got
        an empty one: `read_harness([])` correctly refuses to call that an idle agent, which means
        the honest answer to "what was it doing for four hours?" was *nothing can be said* — for
        the one run nobody can re-observe. `run_and_stream` keeps what was written, both boxes,
        one code path.

        `docker exec` IS A LOCAL SUBPROCESS AND THAT IS WHY THIS BOX CAN STREAM. Its stdout is a
        pipe on the worker carrying the container process's output as it is produced, so the
        `streams` trait can honestly answer True here (`registry.BOXES`).

        WHAT KILLING IT DOES AND DOES NOT REACH, said out loud because a reader will assume the
        stronger thing: killing the `docker exec` CLIENT does not stop the process inside the
        container — the daemon owns that one. It is bounded, not leaked: `cleanup()` issues
        `docker rm -f`, which takes the whole box with it. That was equally true of the
        `subprocess.run(timeout=…)` this replaces; what changes is that we no longer wait on it —
        the previous code could block past its own wall inside `communicate()`."""
