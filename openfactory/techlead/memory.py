"""What the tech-lead has SEEN, TRIED, and whether it WORKED — the thing it did not have.

Until this existed, the tech-lead's entire memory was one number: how many distinct tickets had
failed each way lately. It could say "three tickets failed the same way" and nothing else. It could
not answer the three questions that separate a colleague from a status report:

    have I seen this before?      it could count, but not recognise
    what did I try?               `_remedied` lived in the workflow's memory and DIED with the job,
                                  so every ticket restarted the retry budget from zero
    did it work?                  nothing recorded an outcome at all

The third is the one that costs money. A remedy that has never worked here is indistinguishable
from one that always works, so the factory could retry the same useless thing on every ticket, for
ever, at a full agent pass each time — and each retry looked like diligence.

THE MEMORY IS EPISODIC, NOT A MODEL. One row per intervention: what it saw, what it did, what
happened next. Everything read back out is arithmetic over those rows, which is what makes "I have
tried this four times and it has never worked" a checkable claim rather than an impression.

OUTCOMES ARE OBSERVED, NEVER ASSUMED. An attempt is written down as `pending` and resolved by the
NEXT round looking at the world: the ticket is no longer parked on that signature → it worked; it is
still parked the same way → it did not. Nothing self-reports success, because a remedy that reports
its own outcome is the thing this module exists to stop believing.

AND `unknown` STILL NEVER DEGRADES TOWARD ACTION. History can only make the factory MORE cautious —
it removes remedies that have failed, it never invents one that classification did not offer. The
asymmetry is the same as everywhere else in this system: `observed` is not `accepted`, `learned` is
not `confirmed`, and "it worked once" is not "it works".
