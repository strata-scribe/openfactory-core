"""The client's "funcionou" is what releases production (ADR-0025, board #6).

WHAT IT REPLACED. The pipeline parked at `AWAITING_PROD_APPROVAL` for days waiting for a signal
FROM THE PANEL, with a password, given by an operator. The person who knows whether the change is
right is the client — and they were the only one not asked. Nothing on this board contradicted "no
dev needed" harder: a factory that needs an operator to cut a release is not the factory being
sold.

THE PIECES ALL EXISTED, and that is why this module is small. The workflow already parks durably
on a signal (days, no compute burned). `temporal_view.approve_job` already queries the gate BEFORE
signalling, so an approval is never silently dropped. The acceptance loop already asks a client
whether something worked and reads the answer with a model judge (ADR-0029). What was missing was
the wire between them.

WHY IT IS NOT `bot.act_job`. That function carries a deliberate hard guardrail — Slack may only
ever `resume`/`skip`/`ack`, so a prod release "can never be driven from here even if a caller
asks". That guardrail is about the TECH-LEAD surface, which is an operator's, and it stays exactly
as it is. This is the other surface (ADR-0026): a different channel, a different gate
(`may_act` over the deployment's declared product admins), and a staged confirmation the person
either types or clicks. Punching a hole in the operator path to reach the client's decision would
have merged the two surfaces the platform keeps apart on purpose.

NOTHING HERE DECIDES ANYTHING. This module observes what is parked and delivers a decision somebody
already made in the channel. The authorisation happened before it was called, and the observation
is the workflow's own answer — never this module's belief about it.

    one string, on the deployment's own registry, with no command that writes it — cannot express
    `dev` + `qa` + `producao`, which is exactly the shape a declared promotion chain has. The
    manifest declares it per stage; the promotion reads that manifest inside the box it runs in
    and hands the answer back, and `where_to_look` is how a parked job is asked for it here.

    `""` for a job that declares no address, and the caller must NOT invent one — that is the
    acceptance criterion this card was opened with. A message telling somebody to go and try
    something, with nowhere to go, is worse than one that admits the project never said where.

    ASKED OF THE WORKFLOWS, never of a stored snapshot — the question is what is true NOW, and a
    park nobody answered fires no event a listener could have cached. A job that cannot answer is
    left out rather than guessed at: the cost of missing one is that the next round asks, and the
    cost of inventing one is telling a client something is ready to try when nothing is.

    `^openfactory-{project}-(\\d+)$` the tech-lead's rounds did, and it is reached FROM those

    the client-facing staging bridge was blind too: a job parked waiting for the client's "pode
    subir" was never found, and they were never asked. Now on the shared parser, which also brings
    the sibling-project guard (`openfactory-acme-web-478` is not project `acme`) that the
