"""Organising the house: what the board says, and where it is lying.

The first thing a person taking over a product does is not read code — it is open the board and ask
what is actually happening. What is in flight that should not be. What has been waiting on someone
for a month. What looks finished but was never closed. It is cheap (tracker reads, no code, no
agent), fast, and it produces something useful in the first hour, which matters more on first
contact than anything else this role can do.

IT IS NOT A ONE-OFF. A board rots continuously. The difference between the first pass and every
later one is not the work — it is whether there is a previous pass to compare against. Once a pass
records what it saw, the next one is a DIFF: what is new, what is still stuck, what got worse. That
is what makes it affordable to repeat, and it is the same shape as the knowledge bundle's
regeneration.

THE FIRST PASS WRITES NOTHING. Not to the board, not to the tickets. On first contact this role has
the least context and the most to misread, and closing a ticket destroys information that took
someone effort to write. Authority grows with grounding: once the corpus is confirmed, routine
hygiene becomes its own. The first pass earns its keep by REPORTING.

AND IT READS BEFORE IT JUDGES — the lesson is expensive and recent. On 2026-07-26 two tickets sat in
"In progress" with no job running, which looks exactly like a board lying about its own state. They
were a human-owned spike whose body says "NOT for the automated coding pipeline. Stays OUT of the
TO-DO column", and an epic whose children were being executed. Both were correct. The reading was
wrong, and it was wrong because it judged a column without opening the ticket. Every check here that
could produce that mistake is required to look at labels and body first.
