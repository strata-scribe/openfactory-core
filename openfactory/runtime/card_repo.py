"""C-18 — the product owns the board; the repository travels ON the ticket.

MOVED OUT OF `runtime/temporal/activities.py`, and the reason is a defect this cost. The view lived
beside the Temporal activities, so only the durable path applied it: `openfactory run` called
`build_runner(project, issue)` with the raw registry entry and edited the DEFAULT repository
whatever the card said.

Found on the first real multi-repo ticket. `Deskline/fx-dsk-ui#15` — a card about the
TypeScript UI — produced a PR against `fx-dsk-flows` editing `src/Admissao.cs`, the .NET backend.
The independent review rejected it (score 10, *"the diff only modifies the .NET backend but the
ticket's entire premise is the UI"*), which is the guard working; the routing that put it there is
what this move fixes.

The CLI is what an operator uses to try the platform, and what an onboarding session would use in
front of a client's developers. A capability that works on the poller and not there is a capability
that is missing exactly when somebody is watching.
