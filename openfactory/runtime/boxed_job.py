"""The program that runs INSIDE the box — whatever the box is.

MOVED OUT OF `runtime/fargate/` AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. Not one of the thirteen symbols here
touches AWS: no boto3, no ECS, no CloudWatch. This is the entrypoint of a BOXED JOB — the same
program whether the box is a Fargate task, a Docker container on the client's own EC2 instance, a
pod in their cluster, or a laptop. Its sibling `fargate/launcher.py` is the vendor half (five of
its six symbols are ECS and CloudWatch) and stays where it is.

THE ADDRESS WAS THE LIE, NOT THE CODE. `runtime/temporal/worker.py` imported `materialize_app_key`
from `openfactory.runtime.boxed_job`, and `activities.py` imported `BoxConfig` — the box's own
configuration contract — from the same place, on paths that never go near a cloud. Anybody reading
those lines concludes the worker needs Fargate. It does not, and it never did; `default_sandbox()`
answers `container` unless the deployment declares another box in `OPENFACTORY_SANDBOX`.

The product owner put the principle plainly on 2026-08-06: *"the worker and the job are what
circulate — they have to be entirely local, not least because a client may simply want to bring up
machines (EC2, say) instead of using Fargate."* The code already obeyed it. Only the import path
disagreed, and an import path is what a reader believes.

    provider. A boxed job on an Azure DevOps deployment therefore cloned a github.com URL for a
    repository that lives at `dev.azure.com/{org}/{project}/_git/{repo}` — and Azure's paths nest
    three coordinates where GitHub's take two, so no amount of substituting a host would have
    fixed it. The adapter is the only thing that knows the shape.

    It also cost the GitHub path something: `GH_HOST` was already honoured by the adapter, so a
    GitHub Enterprise deployment cloned from github.com from here while every other read went to
    their own host.
