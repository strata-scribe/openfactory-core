"""The Knowledge Pipeline (§11) — publish the bundle, and hand it to a job.

Phase 2's job is to make the map a real, versioned artifact of the CLIENT repo (§22 D-1/D-2)
without disturbing that repo's normal life. Three functions:

- `publish_bundle`   — push the freshly built bundle to the client repo, post-merge.
- `fetch_published_bundle` — pull the published bundle down for a job to consume.
- `KNOWLEDGE_BRANCH` — where it lives, and why it is not `main`.

**Why a dedicated branch and not `main`.** §22 D-2 left this open and leaned toward `main`
("cleanest — the agent's clone already has it"). Implementing it showed `main` is the wrong
target, for three reasons that have nothing to do with branch protection:

1. **It would trigger the client's deploy.** A project's own CI deploys on push to `main`
   (ADR-0005 watches exactly that). Committing a derived YAML map there fires a real deployment
   for a change that touches no product code — waste, and noise in the deploy history.
2. **It would starve in-flight PRs.** Every commit to `main` puts open PRs BEHIND, and the merge
   loop then spends rebases catching them up (`_REBASE_MAX` exists because a busy base already
   starves jobs). The pipeline would be manufacturing that starvation on every merge.
3. **It needs no protection exemption.** A dedicated branch works whether or not the bot can
   push to a protected `main` — so the capability question stops being load-bearing.

The branch is `openfactory-knowledge` (platform-prefixed, so it cannot collide with a client
branch
that happens to be called `knowledge`), it holds ONLY the `knowledge/` directory, and it
accumulates one commit per source-changing merge — so "what was the map at commit X?" stays
answerable, which was the point of persisting at all.

Everything here is best-effort and never raises at the caller: knowledge is an accelerator, so a
git hiccup must degrade the map, never fail a merged job or a running ticket. Tokened URLs are
redacted from every log line.
