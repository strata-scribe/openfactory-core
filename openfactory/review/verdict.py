    `.acceptance` outside the contract and the adapter returned nothing: asked for, paid for in
    tokens, read by no one.

    WHAT IT COST, measured on the pilot. PR #118 was rejected at score 30. What a person saw was
    a decision, a score and four findings. What was also true: four of six criteria were
    delivered, both hard constraints held, and the change killed a false alarm that had fired on
    every panorama episode ever generated. Reconstructing that took four agents an evening. A
    rejection reads as "this is wrong"; the honest sentence was "this does most of what it
    promised — keep it and finish it", and only the per-criterion map can say which.

    `unknown` IS ITS OWN ANSWER and never folds into either side: a criterion the reviewer could
    not evaluate is not a criterion it passed, and it is not one it failed. Same Option-type rule
    the floor and `disabled_ci_paths` are built on.
