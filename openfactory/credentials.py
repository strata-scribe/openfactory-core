"""Credentials, read from the process environment — the composition root's job, not the kernel's.

These lived in `openfactory/contracts/bot.py` until C-08. A domain model that reads `os.environ` is
not
vendor-named, so no guard catches it, but it is the same mistake: the kernel stops being a set of
values you can construct and becomes something that behaves differently depending on the machine.

Each token is per-AXIS on purpose (ADR-0022). A Jira-tracker plus GitLab-forge project needs a Jira
API token AND a GitLab access token; a single-vendor GitHub project can reuse one for both, which
is what `OPENFACTORY_BOT_TOKEN` is for.
